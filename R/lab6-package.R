#' @description The package provides three different algorithms for solutions to the knapsack problem, 
#' each with different computational complexity. One provides the optimal solution, 
#' but is very computationally expensive, 
#' one is computationally cheaper but provides an optimal solution only for discrete weights 
#' and the third one is a heuristic which is computationally even cheaper, 
#' but the solution is not expected to be as good as for the other two algorithms.
